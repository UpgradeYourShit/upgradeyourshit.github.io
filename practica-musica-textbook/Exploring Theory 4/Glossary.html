The last and most exotic was the enharmonic: a major third, a half step, and<br/>a tiny interval (smaller than a half step), called a diesis.<br/>All these words continue to have meanings based on their original significance to the Greeks. Diatonic music is based on major or minor scales or the church modes; all of which are called diatonic because they resemble the diatonic genus above – they employ whole tones and that type of half step in which the note name changes. Chromatic music involves at least some half steps in which the note name remains the same, as in the chromatic genus. Similarly, the word enharmonic still refers to the relationship between two notes that are written differently and would in theory be separated by a diesis, and yet are played on the same key of the piano, such as E♯ and F.        </p>      </div>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_2748.png" style="left:504px; top:-21px; " alt="page item"/>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_2861.png" style="left:580px; top:550px; " alt="page item"/>  </li><!--PAGE 253-->  <li id="253" class="page">    <div id="item2749" class="pageItem" style="left:36px; top:36px; ">      <div class="textColumn" style="width:45%;">        <p class="SubChapter">Grand Staff</p>        <p class="BasicParagraph">The treble and bass clef staves joined together and used<br/>as a pair.
