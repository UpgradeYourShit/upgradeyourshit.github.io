A pitched tone differs from unpitched noise in<br/>that it has a steady frequency of vibration with partials that are approximate multiples of its fundamental frequency. These are called harmonic partials,<br/>or overtones. Naturally produced musical tones always will be a complex in which the fundamental frequency is accompanied by overtones approximately twice that frequency, three times that frequency, and so on, which form the “overtone series.” The pitch accuracy of these overtones depends on the material producing the vibration. Overtones from an ideally thin and flexible string are mathematically exact multiples of the fundamental frequency,<br/>but a stiffer string’s overtones will be somewhat distorted. Bells are a good example of a musical instrument with noticeably distorted overtones.<br/>For the same reason, a large piano with strings that are thin in relation to their length has clearer, less distorted overtones than a short spinet piano with strings that are thick relative to their length.	    </span></a>	    <!--TOOL TIP END-->                is part of all musical sounds. In some instruments, like bells, the overtones are distorted by the stiffness of the material, but most pitched instruments make a fairly accurate overtone series at least as high as we can hear it (theoretically it goes on forever).

For example, suppose you play A and E together. If the shared overtones almost match, an interference pattern is created that sounds like a wavering or beating. You can, however, carefully raise or lower the pitch of one of the notes until the beating stops, which will happen when the coincident overtones match exactly. At that point the two notes will seem to be in “agreement.” We could also say that they are “in tune.”        </p>      </div>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1828.png" style="left:147px; top:94px; " alt="page item"/>    <div id="item1829" class="pageItem" style="left:157px; top:106px; ">      <p class="ActivityHeader">Figure 15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Six partials of A</p>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1830.png" style="left:158px; top:134px; " alt="page item"/>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1831.png" style="left:630px; top:302px; " alt="page item"/>    <div id="item1832" class="pageItem" style="left:641px; top:314px; ">      <p class="ActivityHeader">Figure 15.5<br/>Fundamental tones A and E and their coincident partials</p>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1833.png" style="left:641px; top:383px; " alt="page item"/>  </li><!--PAGE 218-->  <li id="218" class="page">    <div id="item1834" class="pageItem" style="left:945px; top:702px; ">      <p class="PageNumber">218</p>    </div>    <div id="item1835" class="pageItem" style="left:36px; top:36px; ">    	<div class="textColumn" style="width:49%;">      <p class="BasicParagraph">It’s difficult to hear overtones beyond the first six or so, since they become faint, but the first six are enough. The sixth is a convenient place to stop for other reasons as well: the seventh partial would create an interval that had no possibility of agreement with any of the first six, and the eighth partial is merely an octave, so the next practical partial is the ninth,<br/>which is so quiet that it can’t have much effect on the harmony. The first six partials give us all of the musical intervals that have the potential, if adjusted carefully, of being in agreement or being “consonant.” In fact, our ear accepts these as being basically in agreement even if they are slightly out of tune;<br/>our tolerance seems to extend to the point where the beats become too fast to be easily counted. However, not all intervals have this potential for consonance, because not all of them have matches among the most easily-heard partials. The intervals with a clear potential for agreement are the unison, octave, fifth, fourth, major and minor thirds, and major and minor sixths.<br/>The other intervals, such as the second, have no possibility of matched partials among the first six, and so we regard them as being comparatively unrelated, unstable, or “dissonant.”      </p>      <p class="SubChapter">Instrumental Color</p>      <p class="BasicParagraph">Different musical instruments give varying emphasis to each of the partials, which accounts for a large part of each instrument’s        </div>      <div class="textColumn" style="width:49%; margin-left:2%;">      <p class="BasicParagraph">characteristic “color.” The clarinet, for example, emphasizes<br/>just the odd-numbered partials, whereas the oboe is rich in all<br/>of them. The highest partials of the piano are quieter than those of the harpsichord, and they are also more distorted, since the strings of the piano are thicker in relation to their length. The superior sound of a full-size grand piano is largely due to the longer and relatively thinner strings, which allow more accurate partials and clearer tone.      </p>      <p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="Italic">Changes</span> in partials are also an important part of instrumental color: plucked strings like those of the guitar begin with many partials and lose the higher ones as the sound dies away; a trumpet note, conversely, can begin with relatively few partials and gain more as it progresses. Extraneous noises are significant for some instruments, though we may notice them only when they are missing. These include the wind or “chiff” at the beginning of a note played by a large organ pipe, the thunk of<br/>a piano hammer against the string, and the scraping sounds produced by a violin bow as it attempts to start a string moving. There are also various tones that come from the resonance of other parts of the instrument: the tone of a violin’s wood mixes with the tone produced by the bowed string, for example.<br/>The result is that the sound of an acoustic instrument can be extremely complex, which is why it’s so difficult to imitate electronically.      </p>    </div>  </li><!--PAGE 219-->  <li id="219" class="page">    <div id="item1836" class="pageItem" style="left:945px; top:702px; ">      <p class="PageNumber">219</p>    </div>    <div id="item1837" class="pageItem" style="left:36px; top:36px; ">      <p class="BasicParagraph">Section 2</p>      <p style="width:23%; height:0px; border-top:1px solid; margin-bottom:8px;"><br /></p>      <p class="XLargeText">Temperament</p>    </div>    <div id="item1838" class="pageItem" style="left:37px; top:143px; ">      <div class="textColumn" style="width:49%;">        <p class="BasicParagraph">You might think that the ideal way to tune your piano would<br/>be to make each of the consonant intervals sound exactly in<br/>tune, so that no beating could be heard. Indeed, many musicians have long regarded this as a sort of ideal, but it doesn’t work<br/>out very well on a keyboard with only twelve keys to the octave.<br/>For example, you can tune your A so that it will make a very<br/>nice sixth above your C, and the G as a good fifth above the C, and the D to make a good fifth below A, but then you’ll find<br/>that the G will be out of tune with the D. In other words, it doesn’t come out even; you can’t tune all the consonances to<br/>be simultaneously exactly right unless you have two different keys for some of the notes, such as one D tuned to agree with<br/>G and another D made to work with A.        </p>        <p class="BasicParagraph">This problem was solved in many different ways over the<br/>years.

It’s not possible to tune a piano in such a way that all its intervals are acoustically exact. “Temperaments” adjust a keyboard’s tuning to make a compromise between acoustical exactitude and the limitations of having only 12 keys per octave. “Equal temperament” is the modern standard, in which all half steps are the same size, all major thirds a little larger than acoustically exact major thirds, and all fifths very slightly narrow.	    </span></a>	    <!--TOOL TIP END-->                in which most of the thirds were very good and most of the fifths were only slightly off; this we now call                <!--TOOL TIP BEGIN-->	    <a class="tooltip" href="#">meantone<span class="custom info" style="position: absolute; left: -12em; top: 2em; ">	    <em>Meantone</em> 	    A traditional way of tuning the notes<br/>of the keyboard to make the most common thirds sound more like the acoustically exact third.	    </span></a>	    <!--TOOL TIP END-->                temperament.        </p>        <p class="BasicParagraph">Meantone was used for several centuries and is still enjoyed by connoisseurs of early music, but it had one problem: since four of the less-common thirds were very discordant (and one fifth, the <span class="Italic">wolf fifth</span>, was really awful), meantone didn’t allow the free use of all the intervals in all the keys. So musicians began to alter the compromise a little with the hope of making the wolf and<br/>the bad thirds less objectionable. The Vallotti temperament is a variant of meantone in which the wolf is gone, the bad thirds are not quite so large, and the good thirds are, in trade, not quite so good as they were in normal meantone. Others invented schemes in which some chords have both perfect thirds and perfect fifths and others have varying shades of inexactness; the Kirnberger temperament is an example. In these tunings that grew out of meantone there begins to be some variety in the quality of the acceptable chords, which may have contributed to the notion that different keys have different characters – for example,<br/>C major was thought to be pure and cheerful, while F sharp major was harsh and dark.        </p>      </div>    </div>  </li><!--PAGE 220-->  <li id="220" class="page">    <div id="item1840" class="pageItem" style="left:945px; top:702px; ">      <p class="PageNumber">220</p>    </div>    <div id="item1841" class="pageItem" style="left:36px; top:36px; ">      <p class="BasicParagraph">The temperament that won out in the end, at least so far, was <span class="Italic">equal temperament</span>, in which all the thirds are just barely OK<br/>but all the fifths are very good. Equal temperament has much to recommend it; besides being the same in all keys its large major thirds are well-suited to melody, which is an important factor in our music. For some reason musicians often prefer large thirds<br/>for melody even though the smaller thirds make smoother harmony. Fortunately, most of us are able to accept the larger thirds in harmony, too, especially since the modern piano does not emphasize the higher overtones the way the harpsichord did. Nonetheless, many musicians experiment with tuning, and there may yet be something of a revival of alternate systems, even ones with more<br/>than 12 notes to the octave, which are much easier to implement with electronic musical instruments than they were with<br/>mechanical ones.      </p>      <p class="BasicParagraph">On an Apple® computer you can experiment with temperaments by choosing one from the Temperaments menu in Practica Musica (see Options: Sound and MIDI). Any music you select will be performed with the chosen temperament. The below movie doesn’t require any particular kind of computer. You can listen to it now and hear chords played in Pythagorean, Just, and Equal Temperaments.      </p>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1842.png" style="left:73px; top:349px; " alt="page item"/>    <div id="item1843" class="pageItem" style="left:84px; top:362px; ">      <p class="ActivityHeader">Movie 15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison of tunings</p>    </div>    <div id="item1844" class="pageItem" style="left:84px; top:391px; " alt="page item">      <video width="856" height="152" controls="controls" poster="assets/images/item_1844.png">        <source src="assets/media/appendixmovie15.1.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>        <object width="856" height="152" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="assets/media/flashmediaelement.swf">          <param name="movie" value="assets/media/flashmediaelement.swf"/>          <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/>          <param name="wmode" value="transparent"/>          <param name="flashvars" value="controls=true&file=appendixmovie15.1.mp4"/>          <img src="assets/images/item_1844.png" width="856" height="152" title="No video playback capabilities"/>        </object>      </video>    </div>  </li><!--PAGE 221-->  <li id="221" class="page">    <div id="item1845" class="pageItem" style="left:945px; top:722px; ">      <p class="PageNumber">221</p>    </div>    <img class="pageItem" src="assets/images/item_1846.png" style="left:44px; top:23px; " alt="page item"/>    <div id="item1847" class="pageItem" style="left:58px; top:35px; ">      <p class="ActivityHeader">Figure 15.6&nbsp;&nbsp;    The following is a chart of each of the tunings and temperaments provided with Practica Musica.<br/>The variations in tuning are measured in <span class="Italic">cents</span> (one cent = 1/1200 octave or 1/100 of an equal-tempered half step).<br/>The upper rows show the size of the major third above each note, as compared with the acoustically exact interval,<br/>and the lower rows show the same comparison for the fifth above the given note.
